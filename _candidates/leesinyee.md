biography: >
    Hello everyone! Welcome and let me share a little bit of myself. I’m Lee Sin Yee and I was born and raised in Ipoh, Perak which is a beautiful city in Malaysia. I’m a graduate from Perak Girls’ School and I’ve just completed my foundation study at Sunway College in March 2017. Currently I am a Year 1 student of Bachelor of Business Management in Sunway University. When I was in primary school, I never knew there’ll be a chance for me to become a leader till my teacher suggested and nominated me to become a prefect in school. This is how my leadership journey begins. I was a vice president for Librarian Association and then I applied to become a prefect in my secondary school. There were many ups and downs but I’ve conquered it all. Then my passion to service and help out others had brought me here - which is running for Student Welfare Director in Sunway University Student Council. Why am I running for this position is because I have the passion and willingness to help out the unheard voices among the Sunwayians and hoping I can do something to make Sunway University a better place to study at and enhance the image of Sunway University. My goals basically are all about the benefits and the welfares of Sunwayians and I’ll try to make ways to hear and what Sunwayians want on their behalf. Thank you.

manifestos:
    - title: Creating different platforms for Sunwayians to present their piece of mind
      content: As technology is getting more advanced nowadays, I hope that students can provide or submit their ideas as well as opinions through different mass media and not only stuck onto the old-school style-writing in and putting in the suggestion box.
    - title: Organizing exciting and meaningful events or activities between Sunway University Student Council and Sunwayians
      content: In order to increase the exposure of SUSC among the Sunwayians, activities like ‘Study Relieve’ will be held regularly. Wonder what is it about? Stay tuned for more and other fun events!
    - title: Gathering and getting a focus group with different faculty of students in it
      content: On behalf of exploring and improving the students’ welfare, I suggest that it is a good idea for creating a focus group which involved with different Sunwayians from different schools or faculties. By doing this, I believe that Sunwayians have better access to the Student Welfare Director or to the SUSC.
