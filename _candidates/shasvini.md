   Hello Sunway-ian’s! I’m Shasvini Naidu Nagiah and I’m currently pursuing my 2nd year in the BSc (Hons) Psychology programme. I’m currently running for the position of Community Service Director at Sunway University Student Council! In 2015, I joined the Rotaract Club of Sunway University and was elected as the Community Service Director in June 2016.

  Since then, not only have I been growing tremendously in terms of communication skills as well as leadership skills, but my passion to give back to the society has been growing too! I was the head of registration for MS Walk 2016 as well as the project leader of Sunway Eco Road Relay which happened recently in which the net proceeds were given to an environmental related organisation.

  Recently, I was also elected as the incoming Vice President for the Rotaract Club of Sunway University. I aspire to help more people and help people like you to give back to society for the society needs us! Only with you, can this little dream of mine turn into reality. Hence, vote for me – Shasvini Naidu as your Community Service Director of Sunway University Student Council. Thank you and have a great day!
