biography: >
    Hello Sunway friends! My name is Siew Yong Teck and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Psychology. The study of human behavior interests me as I love meeting people and getting to know how we as humans think and function in our daily lives. 
    
    I consider myself as an extreme extrovert and an outdoors person. If you know me, you’ll know that I love planning activities, going around exploring and just having good fun with friends. With previous involvements in leadership boards, I am rather experienced in group activities and working in a team to organize events. I love coming up with new ideas and new activities to do because I believe there is so much we can and should experience in life. 
    
    A few fun facts about me: I do photography, I live for coffee and red is my color. FYI, I lost 30 kgs in 1 year so that shows you I am determined and focus! * wink * 
    
    My aim is to make our campus more enjoyable and allow every club in our university to have a better platform to be equally active. I am looking forward to serve you! Vote for me, Siew Yong Teck as your next Extra Curricular Director!
