biography: >
  I am Kong Bei Ji, currently pursuing my Bachelor’s Degree in Actuarial Studies under the Sunway Excellence Scholarship. As an avid fan of sports and extracurricular activities, I spent most of my time in high school engaging in club activities as well as being a part of the school team in table tennis, athletics, road-run and volleyball. Those days of numerous trainings and competitions; those blood, sweat, and tears I have shed with my teammates; those long-distanced bus rides, are priceless treasures I bury in the depths of my heart. I have yet to mention the best part of all; I get to skip classes with valid reasons! During my A-Levels studies in Sunway College, I was also part of the A-Levels Student Council.
  
  I personally believe there is no such thing as “failures”. Instead, they are opportunities for us to learn, grow and discover about ourselves; especially our weaknesses. Work on them, and you stand a better chance in your next undertaking. A person curious by nature, I also love challenges. The greater the difficulties I am presented with, the more hyped I get! To me, the adrenaline rush is simply energising.
  
  It is an absolute horror to imagine my life without extracurricular activities. As such, I dedicate myself to creating and harmonising an environment where you can enjoy extracurricular activities to their best.
  
  I am up for the challenge. Are you?
