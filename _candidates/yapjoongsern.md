    Good day Sunway-ians! My name is Yap Joong Sern and I am running for the Presidency of Sunway University Student Council (SUSC). At the moment, I am pursuing my studies in BSc (Hons) Accounting & Finance. I served the Sunway University Student Council (SUSC) for the year 2016/ 2017 as the Student Welfare Department’s executive member and in the process, I realized that the students of Sunway University really deserve much more. 

    In the past, I have taken up many decision-making roles throughout my high school, college, and varsity years. I believe with my experience in decision-making, I will be able to make the right decision for you and your wellbeing as you are a student of Sunway University.

    While serving in the council, I have upheld the responsibility of Project Assistant and Assistant Treasurer for Sunway Fashion Night 2017, Lumiere and Sunway Eco Road Relay 2017 respectively. Furthermore, I have participated actively as a committee of the Food & Beverages Committee of Sunway Education alongside my director, Tan Xiao Yu to ensure that the quality of your meal here is assured. 

    Ultimately, what I want to achieve when I am President is all about you and only you. I want to ensure that your student right is protected. I want to ensure that your experience in Sunway University is worthwhile. I want to ensure that the environment of Sunway University revolves around you. Ever since I graduated high school, I strongly believe that “To serve others is to serve oneself”. Thus, please, put your trust in me and vote for me as your next student representative and President of SUSC.
