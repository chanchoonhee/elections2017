biography: >
   Hey there! My name is Essam Ali. I’m an Egyptian, born and raised in Kuwait where I spent half of my school years at an Indian school initially, then moved onto an Arabic school, from where I moved onto Sunway. I started CIMP in September 2014, and finished June 2015, and then carried on to do my current degree in Communication. I enjoy watching Football & Basketball. Ask me what my favorite teams are I’d tell you Real Madrid for Football & the Spurs for Basketball. I really love public speaking, writing (every now & then), and reading different sorts of books whether it is novels, self-help, philosophical or political books. I’m not the most social of people on a personal level. However, when driven by a goal that serves the greater good, I am capable of being quite extroverted and very easy to bond with. Game of Thrones fan for sure, and a HUGE Lord Of The Rings fan!
