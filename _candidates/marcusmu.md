biography: >
    I have always strived to live a holistic lifestyle, placing importance on both academics and extracurricular activities equally. Perhaps this can be attributed to my high-school days when nearly every student in Catholic High School was actively engaged in clubs and societies. It just so happened that my high school was especially encouraging when it comes to extracurricular activities. I guess I never left that culture behind even upon entering Sunway University in 2014 to pursue a degree in Computer Science.

    Within the first month of university life, I signed myself up to three different clubs representing my three main interests:Taekwondo, badminton and music. What began as a way of meeting new friends and filling up spare time evolved into a journey of honing my leadership and management skills. Most notably, I have been the president of the Sunway Badminton Club, Sunway Taekwondo Club and Sunway University Ensemble respectively. Taking the helm for three clubs has not only opened my eyes to various perspectives in leadership, but also showed me how much I still need to learn before I can become an effective and flexible leader.
