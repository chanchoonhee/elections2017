biography: >
   My name is Marisha Barth Ubrani and for 19 years I was born and raised in Subang Jaya. Within those 19 years, I’ve learnt that I love food (especially Malaysian cuisine), books and people. Part of which is because I grew up in such a diverse community; from my family to my friends and even to my society. From my Dadi’s (grandmother in Sindhi/Hindi) famous Sindhi biryani to my Ah Ma (grandmother in Teochew)’s Black Duck, I couldn’t be more blessed with food and grandmas from the best of both worlds. 
    
    While I enjoy reading in different genres from Tuesday’s with Morrie to the Harry Potter series to Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, when it comes to books, it has thought me more than what was written in the pages. In high school, leading the Library was something that could only be experienced and I have been fortunate to not only learn how to take care of these ‘knowledge holders’ we students find so valuable but to take care of people as well.

    At the end of the day, it’s always the people that inspires me the most. From my late father’s curiosity for knowledge, to my mother’s integrity, to my friends’ uniqueness, and maybe to you too if I get to meet you one day; the people in my life have made me who I am today. Without them, I would not be at the top 2% in AUSMAT last year, I would have not been so active in extra-curriculum activities and I would have missed the chance to be your next Academic Affairs Director.
