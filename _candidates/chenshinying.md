biography: >
    Hello! Good Day to all Sunwayians! My name is Chen Shin Ying Aka Cathy. I am born in Kuala Lumpur and staying in Cheras. I like watching movies, listening to songs and reading articles on the internet during my free time. 

    As a youngest child of 2 children in my family, I always consider myself as a Leadership and extrovert type of person. Why? Because back in primary school I was a class president and in the post of treasurer as well as secretary in 3 clubs. 

    In college, I was the leader for most of my group assignments. I like to take up the initiative as the role of being a leader in not just academically. For instance, I was a former Team Leader of Food Bank Charity Osiris Kechara. The reason I joined is because volunteering is a great way to give back the community as well as an empowerment to young adults.  I think it should be emphasized and encouraged to the students. Which I think Sunway has an excellent platform to offered for the students to gain these amazing experiences from. 

    Lastly, ever since I got into Sunway, it has changed me tremendously from participating in many competitions and challenges such as HSBC case competition and that is how I got out of my comfort zone. As it has given me an opportunity to show what I am capable of and sharpen my skills at the same time. 

    My motto is Work hard while live life to the fullest!
