biography: >
    From the last August, the moment I stepped into Sunway University, looking at the tall building, 2 artistic birds, I imagined, what would I spend my 3years time at here? Besides of studying, pursuing a good CGPA, dating a girl (if I could), what could I do, to make my University life a little bit different? What could I do, to prove my value, my existence?
    
    Hi Sunwayians! I’m Law Zhun Khing, a fellow from Bsc(Hons) Financial Analysis August 2016 intake. I’m still a dreamer, I dream how big we could be; I dream, how many changes we could bring; I dream, how many girlfriends I could get…etc. Yes, you didn’t see wrong. Dream. As BlackBeard from Onepiece once said:‘HUMAN DREAMS, ARE NEVER END!’. Erm..I think nope. Our dream, end at the moment, we step out from university, to reality.

    University is the last shelter of us, a shelter where we still could chill, arrive late, watch series, stay up late, without huge financial costs or family burden. What I should do now, is shorten the gap between this dream and reality, starting to learn how to cook, starting to get rid of my bad habits, trying to try everything I could try…... Yeah, isn’t it?
