    Hi Sunway-ians! My name is Kang Sher Enn (but you can just call me Sherenn) and I am a second year Accounting and Finance student under the Lancaster University degree programme. My hobbies are reading and writing because I see them as crucial steps in the process of gaining and sharing new knowledge. Fundamentally, I am an individual who likes to discover and explore the different possibilities in life. This is reflected by the numerous events, activities, and clubs that I have been a part of. This journey has allowed me to gain invaluable experience and further refine my communication, teamwork, and analytical skills. Finding a balance between my academic responsibilities and extracurricular activities has not been easy, but throughout the process, it has taught me how to perform under pressure and has helped improve my planning and time management skills.  I believe that life is about challenging yourself, breaking free of your comfort zone, and pushing beyond your limits to achieve greatness. As such, I am ready to take up any challenges that life will send my way and I will embrace them as opportunities for self-development.
